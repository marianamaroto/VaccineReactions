# VaccineReactions

This project aims to cluster COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions. The purpose of the project is one, having a detailed understanding of the common types of adverse reactions, and two, identifying depending on the personâ€™s adverse reactions, medical history, allergies, gender, age, and vaccine manufacturer, if they are at a higher risk of suffering a serious effect that could be life threatening.

After the COVID-19 virus emerged in late 2019, it triggered an urgent international response to develop a preventive COVID-19 vaccine. On December 11th 2020, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Since then, there has been a massive vaccination campaign across the United States. Although generally safe, no prescription drug or biological product, such as a vaccine, is completely free from side effects. Vaccines protect many people from dangerous illnesses, but for a very small percentage its side effects may be serious. 

This project uses the data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which was created by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to receive reports about adverse events that may be associated with vaccines. Medical professionals are encouraged to report adverse events, VAERS data will contain coincidental events that might not be related to vaccine. Also, due to the human element in data input we can expect incomplete cases.
