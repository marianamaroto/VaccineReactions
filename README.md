# VaccineReactions
Our application project will aim to cluster COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions. The purpose of the project is having a detailed understanding of the common types of adverse reactions and  identifying which adverse reactions are in need of immediate care. This project suggests a two-step approach. First, we will use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (clustering) to segment adverse reactions into groups. This will give us the most common symptoms for each group. Second, using the vaccine reaction clusters, along with additional patient information (gender, age) and vaccine manufacturer information, we will predict the need of urgent medical care (by using fatality rate).
